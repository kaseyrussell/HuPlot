HuPlot
======

A graphical python program for plotting and analyzing fluorescence spectrum data files (SPE files from the program Winspec) and time-resolved photon counting data files (PHD files from PicoQuant software).


Note: This package depends on a few modules from another of my hosted packages (kaseyrussell/python_misc_modules).
